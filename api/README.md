## New Location Onboarding

To onboard a new tour location, you'll need a place id from [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).
The place id allows you to fetch photos from google maps. Having the ID on hand means we save an API call required to get it.

You'll also need the gps coordinates.
